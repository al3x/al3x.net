================

This has been a Big Year for me. In 2010 I:

1.  Got married.
2.  Moved from [San Francisco](http://al3x.net/2009/10/04/so-youre-moving-to-san-francisco.html) to Portland, Oregon.
3.  Quit my job at Twitter.
4.  [Joined BankSimple](http://al3x.net/2010/05/17/something-new.html).
5.  Helped BankSimple [raise our $2.9M Series A funding](http://banksimple.com/blog/2010/09/01/funding-next-steps/).
6.  Organized the first [Emerging Languages Camp](http://al3x.net/2010/04/05/elc.html), which was successful enough that it’s going to become a regular part of OSCON.
7.  [Bought a house](http://al3x.net/2010/10/07/house.html) in Portland’s West Hills and moved into it.

In 2011 I will:

1.  Ship [BankSimple](https://www.banksimple.com/).

That’s it. Anything else I accomplish next year is gravy.
